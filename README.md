When you pair the best organic coffee beans, the best roasters and the best equipment and techniques, you achieve the Best Cup of Coffee.

## Firebase Data Structure

The database structure gets built automatically by the app when you register a new user. No need to manually build the schema.

## Firebase Security and Rules

The Firebase Security Rules for BrewCoffeeCo can be found in the Gist below.
A user is granted access (read/write) by house_id and the security rules have been tested to guarantee no unauthorized access is allowed.
However, the rules need to be enhanced to: (1) prevent users from modifying a house_id,
(2) for a newly created account, the user needs to logout and log back in for the rules to work
